> Puppeteer script to scrape English quizzes

Since December 2018, Quizlet has paused issuing new API keys, so I created this script as a workaround to scrape data from this site. Scraped data (english quizzes) will then be processed and used as question bank for my chrome extension later.

## Installation
``` bash
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Run the script
node index.js
```
